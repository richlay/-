<li>worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s</li>
<li>2021 would only see a partial recovery
<ul>
<li><strong>If</strong> the pandemic eased in the second half of 2020, the IMF expected to see a partial recovery next year</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UN study said 81% of the world's workforce, 3.3 billion people had had their place of work fully or partly closed because of the outbreak</li>
<li><strong>Emerging markets</strong> and <strong>developing countries</strong> would be the hardest hit, requiring hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid</li>
<li>over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52231929"> Americans seeking unemployment benefits had surged for the third week</a> by 6.6 million, bringing the total over that period to more than 16 million</li>

<li>1.the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth</li>
<li>2.government action may not be enough to stop the decline</li>

</li>
<li>$$\therefore$$ central banks in many countries, e.g. United Kingdom, have slashed interest rates <code>i.e. cheaper borrowing and encourage spending</code></li>
<li>US Senate passed a $2 trillion (£1.7tn) coronavirus aid bill to help workers and businesses</li>
<li>travel industry damaged badly, $$\because$$ airlines cut flights and tourists cancel business trips and holidays</li>

<li>Data that are released with short lag time

<li>Continually low claims would offer a sign that employers are trying to hold on to workers in a tight labor market given the virus could soon pass. It doesn't, however, mean companies will continue to hire at the robust pace seen in recent months</li>

<li>The rapid spread of the virus emphasizes the need for real-time data</li>
<li>cons: only tells a small slice of consumer behavior</li>
<li>e.g.
<ul>
<li>job search sites: more workers look for jobs that works from home;
while employers look for workers to respond to the epidemic, such as
nurses and epidemiologists</li>
<li>box office receipts</li>

<ul>
<li>Comparing with 2008, governments now come to agree with their policies
<ul>
<li>previously cautious European Central Bank U-turned, launching a $809 billion stimulus program that includes the bold possibility of backstopping the eurozone's weakest governments</li>
<li>Federal Reserve has deployed all the tools developed during the liquidity crunch 12 years ago—including facilities to support banks and companies and currency swaps with other central banks</li>
<li>since the 1970s, fiscal stimulus had been abandoned as a primary tool to stabilize employment, but now it has changed</li>
<li>The Trump administration wanted to mail $250 billion in checks to Americans, called helicopter money, giving everyone a basic income</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What has changed?
<ul>
<li>Usually, subsidizing consumers is resisted by businesses because it goes against the moral principle &quot;you shall earn your bread in sweat&quot;; the virus is an external crisis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Announced fiscal stimulus may still not be enough, especially in Europe, like back in 2008 if officials and governments don't back the second round government support to fight umemployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-economy-will-survive-the-coronavirus-11586103392">The Economy Will Survive the Coronavirus</a> #wsj #4/5
<ul>
<li>People that benefits
<ul>
<li>pharmacies, groceries and big-box retailers are taking on more part-time employees and paying more overtime</li>
<li>home appliance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No not despair
<ul>
<li>We learn from wrong beliefs, because when we are right, there's &quot;confirmation bias&quot;</li>
<li>The cost after three month of quarantine
<ul>
<li>the business that decline under competitive pressure tend to be small and young, so were the big companies bag in the days; therefore, the survivors mature</li>
<li>we are not a feeble society, see North Korea or Venezuela, who don't even need a pandemic to see empty shelves in store</li>
<li>we will never know if the policy makers are overeating, but the anxiety will eventually be gone</li>
<li>IN FACT, more money buying goods during stretched production schedule might lead to inflation, which is actually the opposite of what happens when staying at home</li>
